     <p>  Write a program to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,with two exceptions. 
        For numbers divisible by 3, print"Fizz"instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print"Buzz"instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print"FizzBuzz"for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print"Fizz"or"Buzz"for numbers divisible by only one of those).(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed outa significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, yourlabor market value just went up.)
